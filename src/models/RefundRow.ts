/**
 * Geins Management API
 *  Geins Management API is a RESTful api that powers your applications and helps you manage your Geins services. Geins provides an easy-to-use and scalable solution for managing all aspects of an online store, from product listings and customer information to order processing and payment transactions.   :::tip Tip With this API, you can build custom applications and integrate with third-party systems, feeds, dashboards and other bussiness logic apps. :::    ## Getting started Once you have created an account, you can start using the Management API by creating an `API User`. You can create as many API users as you need. Each `API user` is connected to a specific account so you can keep track of operations and manage keys.   You can find all your API credentials in `Geins Merchant Center`.   ### Fast track Use one of our [SDKs](https://docs.geins.io/docs/sdk/introduction) to get started quickly. The SDKs are available for the most popular programming languages and frameworks.  Or, if you prefer to just take it for a test run:  [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/25895885-aaf6598f-1a7c-4949-85d7-ba846c42d553?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D25895885-aaf6598f-1a7c-4949-85d7-ba846c42d553%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Da2a179ce-158e-46b0-8d06-e9640f45112c)  ### Authentication Two authentication methods are required:   - `Basic Auth`   - `API Key`    All API credentials can be found in `Geins Merchant Center`.  #### Basic Auth A Basic auth `Authorization` header needs to be included in every request. The value should be `Basic <credentials>` where `<credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of your `API username` and `API password` joined by a single colon `:`.   See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) for more information on Basic auth.  #### API Key  An `X-ApiKey` header needs to be included in every request. This header should contain the value of your `API key`.  #### Example ```bash curl -X GET \"https://mgmtapi.geins.io/API/Market/List\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Basic [USER-CREDENTIALS-BASE64-ENCODED]\" \\ -H \"X-ApiKey: [API-KEY]\" ```
